# About

This is a project to help familiarize myself with Vue and the way it handles data (minus VueX), knex and PostgreSQL, and ChartJS. The goal was to create an application that could help track your stock portfolio.

# Challenges

* I used a ChartJS wrapper for Vue that was the most starred, but not the most useable.
* Getting the charts to the size I wanted, but now they're not responsive.
* The stock data is coming from the AlphaVantage API, which takes a VERY long time to load in.
* Styling is funny.

# Installation

* Clone the repo to your machine by clicking the green clone button, copying the url, then in your terminal of choice typing `git clone [url]`
* CD into the folder you cloned.
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* To check it out locally run `npm run dev`, then command-click the address.

# Future Iterations

* Change the styling so it looks mature.
* Add more meaningful information to the stock cards.
* Add OAuth.
